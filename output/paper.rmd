## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

In order to get further familiarized with the dataset and estimate the possible associations between the nation's average income and other factors, exploratory analysis is carried out by conducting data visualizations to observe whether the patterns between certain factors matches the generally expectations of the trend of income and income inequality in Canada. First, we will have a look through the overall trend of income level in Canada.

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
